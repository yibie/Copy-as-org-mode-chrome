* Copy as Org-Mode for Chrome

This WebExtension is a Chrome version of Firefox extension: [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-as-org-mode/][Copy as Org-Mode for Firefox]], which is developed by [[https://github.com/kuanyui][kuanyui]].

And I'm add some new features for Chrome version:

- Add *Save Page as Org-Mode* to context menu.
  - This will save the current page as an Org-mode file. 
  - Uses *Defuddle* for intelligent content extraction (cleaner than raw HTML).
  - Includes rich metadata in the header: =#+TITLE=, =#+AUTHOR=, =#+DATE=, =#+SOURCE_URL=, and =#+KEYWORDS=.
  - Generates an intelligent filename: =Author__Title==keyword1_keyword2.org=.
  - Images are excluded in this mode for a pure text experience.
- Add *Save Page as Org-Mode (With Images)* to context menu.
  - This will save the page as an Org file *with all images downloaded locally*.
  - Uses the same Defuddle extraction logic.
  - Images are saved to an =images/= subfolder next to the Org file.
  - Image links in the Org file use relative paths (e.g., =[[./images/image_xxx.jpg]]=).

** How to Use "Save Page as Org-Mode (With Images)"

1. Right-click on any webpage.
2. Select *"Save Page as Org-Mode (With Images)"*.
3. A new tab will open. Click *"Select Folder & Save"*.
4. Choose any folder on your computer (e.g., =~/Documents/Notes=).
5. The browser will ask for permission to edit files in that folder. Click *"Edit"*.
6. Done! Your =.org= file and =images/= folder are saved together.

*** Special Note for Brave Browser Users

By default, Brave disables the *File System Access API*. To use the direct folder saving feature:
1. Open =brave://flags= in your address bar.
2. Search for =File System Access API=.
3. Set it to **Enabled**.
4. Relaunch Brave.
If the API is still unavailable, the extension will automatically fallback to downloading a **ZIP file** containing your Org file and images.

* Installation

1. Download the zip file from [[https://github.com/yibie/Copy-as-org-mode-chrome][Copy as Org-Mode for Chrome]]. 
   - You can also clone the repository and build it by yourself.
2. Unzip the file and open Chrome.
3. Click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar.
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the unzipped folder.
