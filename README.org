* Copy as Org-Mode for Chrome

This WebExtension is a Chrome version of Firefox extension: [[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/copy-as-org-mode/][Copy as Org-Mode for Firefox]], which is developed by [[https://github.com/kuanyui][kuanyui]].

And I'm add some new features for Chrome version:

- Add Save Page as Org-Mode to context menu.
  - This will save the current page as an Org-mode file and save it to the a directory that you can choose.
- *NEW:* Add *Save Page as Org-Mode (With Images)* to context menu.
  - This will save the page as an Org file *with all images downloaded locally*.
  - Images are saved to an =images/= subfolder next to the Org file.
  - Image links in the Org file use relative paths (e.g., =[[./images/image_xxx.jpg]]=).

** How to Use "Save Page as Org-Mode (With Images)"

1. Right-click on any webpage.
2. Select *"Save Page as Org-Mode (With Images)"*.
3. A new tab will open. Click *"Select Folder & Save"*.
4. Choose any folder on your computer (e.g., =~/Documents/Notes=).
5. The browser will ask for permission to edit files in that folder. Click *"Edit"*.
6. Done! Your =.org= file and =images/= folder are saved together.
